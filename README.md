Making Minecraft more realistic and adding a few bucks to the difficulty

 /*****************************************************************************************************
 * This plugin's goal is making Minecraft a more realistic and also more
 * difficult experience. To make it a real "survival" game and not just
 * a lego simulator (nothing against that).
 * FEATURE LIST:
 * - You cannot mine Blocks with bare hands, to craft your first set
 *   of tools you need to collect things such as sticks from tree leaves
 *   or flint from the ground (destroying grass), which leads to
 * - New drops have been added, such as sticks from leaves, so that the player
 *   is able to continue in his adventure while not being able to mine specific
 *   blocks anymore
 * - Adding to the aspect of getting hungry, there is now also Weather affecting
 *   your character. If it stroms (or rains, which is sadly the same) you freeze
 *   and loose life. To prevent this you have to wear armor. Different armor has different
 *  stats. Leather protects the most from weather and Iron and Gold the least.
 * - Recipes have been changed, tools such as a wooden axe (srsly a wooden axe to cut wood?)
 *   have been completely removed while many other tools recipe has simply changed.
 * - There are more features to come AND:
 *   ALL THESE FEATURES ARE NOT FINISHED AND PROBABLY WILL NEVER BE REALLY "FINISHED"
 *   THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE TO ADD, THE AMOUNT OF FEATURES IS JUST DEPENDENT ON THE
 *   TIME USED TO WORK ON THIS PLUGIN

 There are no dependencies. This is a stand-alone plugin.
 The .jar represents always the latest build, so no need to compile the plugin on your own.
